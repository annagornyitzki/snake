## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows players to control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food, with the objective of avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the game.
- `snake.css`: Contains the styles for the game interface.
- `snake.js`: The main JavaScript file that contains the game logic.

## Game Logic
The game logic is implemented in `snake.js`, which includes:
- **Game Loop**: The core loop that updates the game state and renders the graphics.
- **Snake Movement**: Functions to control the snake's direction and movement.
- **Food Placement**: Logic to randomly place food on the game board.
- **Game Over Conditions**: Checks for collisions with walls or the snake itself.

## How to Run
